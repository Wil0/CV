An enthusiastic, avid learner about everything life has to offer, and especially a passion for new technologies. I am proud to have had the opportunity to work in two different countries, Spain and England, this has taught me how important it is to be open-minded, flexible and adaptable. I am always keen to learn and see tough challenges as a part of the process of growing and gaining experience of other cultures and working styles. I am now looking for a new adventure and a new challenge within a friendly team that likes sharing both personal and professional aspects of life.

## Skills

#### Attention to detail

During my time working as a member of the accounts team at Mieres Tubos I learnt to be very precise, every single piece of information had to be just right. During our monthly closed periods accuracy was key. The accounts had to be kept up to date and ready to be presented without delays, it was my responsibility to take care of the final draft and make sure everything was perfect.

#### Pair programming

I truly enjoy working side by side with passionate people from whom I can learn and to whom I can contribute with my experience. When at university I found out than it was much easier learning by sharing knowledge. At Makers Academy I have had the opportunity to put this into practice again. Some times I would be faced with a difficult personality to pair with but I would always make sure that the working environment was enjoyable and fun whilst professional and productive.

#### Communication

My past experience has shown me that it is always important for everyone in the team to be aware and to understand what the working process is. At Capita's Accounts Receivable team, as there were so many of us, it was very important to keep everyone well informed. During a particular month with an unexpected amount of work I found this incredibly useful and especially important when I had to avoid overlapping tasks in the team.

#### Fast learner

I have always found it easy to learn new things, I was able to immerse myself in a highly demanding English work environment six months after arriving in England. During the 12 weeks in Makers Academy I had the chance to push myself even further, learning completely new programming languages in both a short space of time and a foreign language.

**Projects I contributed to:**

- [*MakersBnB*](https://github.com/Wil0/makersBnB): A clone of AirBnb that allows the user to view, request and book places to spend the night when travelling.
- [*Regexperts*](https://github.com/Wil0/regexperts): A website that allows the user to learn about regular expressions in a fun and entertaining way.

## Hobbies

- I like reading Stephen King novels, they make me travel back in time to the 50's - 70's where life was quieter but sadly lacking in technology.
- I have recently developed a taste for table tennis, I am not a very good player yet, but it is just a matter of time!
