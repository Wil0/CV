## Emilio Menendez

An enthusiastic, avid learner about almost anything life has to offer and specially with a fond passion for new technologies. I am proud of having had the opportunity of working in two different countries gainning experience of other cultures and working styles that tought me the benefits of being flexible and adaptable. I am kow looking for a new adventure and a new challenge within a friendly team that likes sharing both personal and proffesional aspects of life.

## Skills

#### Attention to detail

During my time working as member of Mieres Tubos's Accounts team I learnt to be very precise looking after every single piece of information. Accuracy was key to maintain it up to date and ready to release whithout delays.

#### Pair programming

I really enjoy working within a team or with another person from whom I can learn and to whom I can contribute with my experience. When at university I found out than it was much easier learning by sharing ideas, skill I have developed during my time at Makers Academy, where I have had the opportunity of interacting with very different types of personalities, being always sucessful in terms of keeping the working environment happy and fun while proffesional and productive.

#### Communication

My past experience has shown me that it is very important for everyone in the team to be aware and undesrtand what the working proccess is. Working at Capita's Accounts Receivable team taught me that communication is key when the tasks are split into several teams but what really matters is the whole output afterwards.

#### Fast learner

I have always found easy to learn new things, I was able to inmerse myself in a highly active English work environment six months after arriving to England. During the 12 weeks in Makers Academy I had the chance to push myself even further, learning completely new things in a short time.
