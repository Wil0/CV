An enthusiastic, avid learner about almost anything life has to offer and specially with a fond passion for new technologies. I am proud of having had the opportunity of working in two different contries, Spain and England, that have taught me how important it is being open-minded, flexible and adaptable, always keen to learn and see the tough experiences as a part of the process of learning and gaining experience of other cultures and working styles. I am now looking for a new adventure and a new challenge within a friendly team that likes sharing both personal and professional aspects of life.

## Skills

#### Attention to detail

During my time working as member of Mieres Tubos's Accounts team I learnt to be very precise looking after every single piece of information. Month-end was the period when accuracy was key to maintain the accounts up to date and ready to be presented without delays.

#### Pair programming

I really enjoy working within a team or with another person from whom I can learn and to whom I can contribute with my experience. When at university I found out than it was much easier learning by sharing knowledge. At Makers Academy I have had the opportunity of putting it again into practice. During one of those difficult days pairing with a very different type of personality, I managed to keep the working environment enjoyable and fun while professional and productive.

#### Communication

My past experience has shown me that it is very important for everyone in the team to be aware and understand what the working process is. Working at Capita's Accounts Receivable team where the number of people involved was large, it was very important to keep everyone well informed, having frequent meetings either as a group or one to one in a daily basis. This was specially important when the team had to deal with an unexpected amount of work for a month that pushed us to keep the feedback going back and forth.

#### Fast learner

I have always found easy to learn new things, I was able to immerse myself in a highly demanding English work environment six months after arriving to England. During the 12 weeks in Makers Academy I had the chance to push myself even further, learning completely new programmming languages in a short space of time.

**Projects I contributed to:**

- [*MakersBnB*](https://github.com/Wil0/makersBnB): A clone of AirBnb that allows the user to view, request and book places to spend the night when travelling.
- [*Regexperts*](https://github.com/Wil0/regexperts): A website that allows the user to learn about regular expressions in a fun and entertainning way.

## Hobbies

- I like reading Stephen King's novels, they usually make me travel back in time to the 50's - 70's where life was quieter but sadly lacked of technology.
- I have recently developed a taste for table tennis, I am not very good player yet, but it is just a matter of time!
