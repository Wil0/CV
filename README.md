I have a need for challenges. It helps me to keep my brain sharp. And I found out a way to do so whilst practicing what I truly like to do: coding.
I did not have a computer until I was around 15 years old. My mum was afraid of the Internet and I don’t blame her. I guess that getting my that PC was my very first real challenge, but it was definitely worth it.  And once I stepped on my recently discovered new world, I was not going to let it go.
Nevertheless life got in the way and at university I studied Business Administration. I soon realized that the thing that appealed me the most was to figure out a solution when a new problem would come across. Surprisingly, it was not the solution what satisfied me but the previous research, the challenge which would push me to go on until I’d got there.
Same thing happened to me in the professional world. I liked what I was doing, but I needed more. So my first decision was to come to England because I wanted to experience a different work environment and well, because I wanted a new challenge. Several months of struggle and here I was when I came across a 12-week course in London that would teach you how to be a web developer. They asked you for just one thing: Are you ready to take the challenge?
I think you can guess my answer.


## Skills

#### Attention to detail

During my time working as a member of the accounts team at Mieres Tubos I learnt to be very precise, every single piece of information had to be just right. During our monthly closed periods accuracy was key. The accounts had to be kept up to date and ready to be presented without delays, it was my responsibility to take care of the final draft and make sure everything was perfect.

#### Pair programming

I truly enjoy working side by side with passionate people from whom I can learn and to whom I can contribute with my experience. When at university I found out than it was much easier learning by sharing knowledge. At Makers Academy I have had the opportunity to put this into practice again. Some times I would be faced with a difficult personality to pair with but I would always make sure that the working environment was enjoyable and fun whilst professional and productive.

#### Communication

My past experience has shown me that it is always important for everyone in the team to be aware and to understand what the working process is. At Capita's Accounts Receivable team, as there were so many of us, it was very important to keep everyone well informed. During a particular month with an unexpected amount of work I found this incredibly useful and especially important when I had to avoid overlapping tasks in the team.

#### Fast learner

I have always found it easy to learn new things, I was able to immerse myself in a highly demanding English work environment six months after arriving in England. During the 12 weeks in Makers Academy I had the chance to push myself even further, learning completely new programming languages in both a short space of time and a foreign language.

**Projects I contributed to:**

- [*MakersBnB*](https://github.com/Wil0/makersBnB): A clone of AirBnb that allows the user to view, request and book places to spend the night when travelling.
- [*Regexperts*](https://github.com/Wil0/regexperts): A website that allows the user to learn about regular expressions in a fun and entertaining way.

- I have recently developed a taste for table tennis, I am not a very good player yet, but it is just a matter of time!
