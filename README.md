An enthusiastic, avid learner about almost anything life has to offer and specially with a fond passion for new technologies. I am proud of having had the opportunity of working in two different countries gaining experience of other cultures and working styles that taught me the benefits of being flexible and adaptable. I am now looking for a new adventure and a new challenge within a friendly team that likes sharing both personal and professional aspects of life.

## Skills

#### Attention to detail

During my time working as member of Mieres Tubos's Accounts team I learnt to be very precise looking after every single piece of information. Accuracy was key to maintain it up to date and ready to release without delays.

#### Pair programming

I really enjoy working within a team or with another person from whom I can learn and to whom I can contribute with my experience. When at university I found out than it was much easier learning by sharing knowledge, skill I have developed during my time at Makers Academy, where I have had the opportunity of interacting with very different types of personalities, being always successful in terms of keeping the working environment enjoyable and fun while professional and productive.

#### Communication

My past experience has shown me that it is very important for everyone in the team to be aware and understand what the working process is. Working at Capita's Accounts Receivable team taught me that communication is key when the tasks are split into several teams aiming to fulfil a final project as a whole.

#### Fast learner

I have always found easy to learn new things, I was able to immerse myself in a highly demanding English work environment six months after arriving to England. During the 12 weeks in Makers Academy I had the chance to push myself even further, learning completely new things in a short space of time.

## Hobbies

- I like reading Stephen King's novels, they usually make me travel back in time to the 50's - 70's where life was quieter but sadly lacked of technology.
- I have recently developed a taste for table tennis, I am not very good player yet, but it is just a matter of time!
